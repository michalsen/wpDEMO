Secure your site against hacking attacks such as User Enumeration
== Description ==

Fullworks WP VPS Security is plugin built to help protect VPS and Dedicated Servver installations of WordPress, butr also can be used happily on Shared Hosting accounts.

The primary feature is Stop User Enumeration, a feature that detects your WordPress usernames from being enumerated by hackers.

User Enumeration is a type of attack where nefarious parties can probe your website to discover your login name. This is often a pre-cursor to brute-force password attacks. Stop User Enumeration helps block this attack and even allows you to log IPs launching these attacks to block further attacks in the future.

As the attack IP is logged you can use (optional additional configuration) fail2ban to block the attack directly at your server's firewall, a very powerful solution for VPS owners to stop brute force attacks as well as DDoS attacks.

Since WordPress 4.5 user data can also be obtained by API calls without logging in, this is a WordPress feature, but if you don't need it to get user data, this
plugin will restrict and log that too.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. If needed to change defaults settings, visit the settings page

== Frequently asked questions ==

= It doesn't seem to work! ==
Are you logged in?  This plugin won't do anything for logged in users, it only works when you are logged out. A common mistake is to install the plugin and test it, while still logged in as admin.
= Are there any settings? =
Yes, but the default ones are fine for most cases
= Will it work on Multisite? =
Yes
= Why don't I just block with .htaccess =
A .htaccess solution may suffice, but most published do not cover POST blocking, REST API blocking and still allow admin users access.
= Does it break anything? =
If a comment is left by someone just giving a number that comment would be forbidden, as it is assume a hack attempt, but the plugin has a bit of code that strips out numbers from comment author names
= Do I need fail2ban for this to work? =
No, but fail2ban will allow you to block IP addresses at your VPS firewall that attempt user enumeration.
= What do I do with the fail2ban file?=
You only need this if you are using Fail2Ban.
Place  the file wordpress-userenum.conf in your fail2ban installation's filter.d directory.
edit your jail.local  to include lines like
`[wordpress-userenum]
enabled = true
filter = wordpress-userenumaction   = iptables-allports[name=WORDPRESS-USERENUM]
           sendmail-whois-lines[name=WORDPRESS-USERENUM, dest=youremail@yourdomain, logpath=/var/log/messages]
logpath = /var/log/messages
maxretry = 1
findtime = 600
bantime = 2500000`

Closed potential REST API bypass

Security fix to stop XSS exploit

Also coded so should work with PHP 5.3 - although PHP 5.3. has been end of life for over two years it seems some hosts still use this. This is a security risk in its own right and
sites using PHP 5.3 should try to upgrade to a supported version of PHP, but this change is for backward compatibility.

= 1.3.7 =

Fix to allow deprecated PHP Version 5.4 to work, as 5.4 seems to still be in common use despite end of life

Note this code wont work on PHP 5.3

= 1.3.6 =

Fix PHP error

= 1.3.5 =

* full rewrite
* Changed detection rules to stop a reported bypass
* Added detection and suppression of REST API calls to user data
